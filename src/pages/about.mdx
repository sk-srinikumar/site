## Design

I immigrated to the U.S. when I was 5. My first trip to an American grocery store was something else. I walked on a sidewalk, crossed a street when a traffic light told me to and I was greeted by an automatic door. These things made life nicer than what I was used to.

It’s funny to think I became a designer cause I went to my local Vons. 

I’m addicted to improving the functionality of everything. If you get a chance to work with me, you’ll notice I say “efficient” too much. 
It’s another way of saying "do more for less”.


## Music

I've been making music since 2018. I find I'm naturally good at jazz but I prefer producing hip hop. It's much harder than you think.

My comfort zones are Japanese city pop, David Bowie, and Playboi Carti. Here are some very old snippets of some songs I'm working on.

## Ziggy

The most important thing going on in my life is my dog.
She's a <Age /> year old German shepherd + rottweiler mix. Don't talk to me for too long, she WILL get jealous.

Guess who Ziggy is named after?
