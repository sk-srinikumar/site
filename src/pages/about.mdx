## Design

I’m Srinivasan Kumaresan. But Srini Kumar is more user-friendly right?

I immigrated to the U.S. when I was 5. My first trip to an American grocery store was something else. I walked on a sidewalk, crossed a street when a traffic light told me to and I was greeted by an automatic door. These things made life nicer than what I was used to.

It’s funny to think I became a designer cause I went to my local Vons. 

I’m addicted to improving the functionality of everything. If you get a chance to work with me, you’ll notice I say “efficient” too much. 
It’s another way of saying "solve the problem for less”.


## Music

In 2018, I picked up a book on music theory, took a poetry class, bought a dusty midi keyboard off of eBay, and purchased Logic Pro X. 

My comfort zones are Japanese city pop, David Bowie, and Kanye West. Lately, I’ve opened up to jazz and video-game soundtracks. Here are some very old snippets of some songs I'm working on.

## Ziggy

The most important thing going on in my life is my dog.
She's a <Age />-year-old German shepherd + rottweiler mix.
I have a special bond with Ziggy because we are both working through childhood trauma. She doesn't try to murder strangers on our walks anymore. And I've become less stressed overall. We made progress by helping each other.

Guess who Ziggy is named after?
