## Design

I’m Srinivasan Kumaresan. But Srini Kumar is more user-friendly right?

I immigrated to the U.S. when I was 5. My first trip to an American grocery store was something else. I walked on a sidewalk, crossed a street when a traffic light told me to and was greeted by an automatic door. These things made life nicer than what I was used to.

It’s funny to think I became a designer cause I went to my local Vons. 

I’m addicted to improving the functionality of everything. If you get a chance to work with me, you’ll notice I say “efficient” too much. 
It’s another way of saying “do better for less”.


## Music

In 2018, I picked up a book on music theory, took a poetry class, bought a dusty midi keyboard off of eBay, and purchased Logic Pro X. It’s 2021 and I’m finally ready to build an album… once I buy the gorgeous blue Fender Jazzmaster I’m saving up for. 

My comfort zones are Japanese city pop, David Bowie, and Kanye West. Lately, I’ve opened up to jazz and video-game soundtracks. Here are snippets of some songs I'm working on.

## Robots

When I worked as a scientist & product designer, I invented the world's cheapest method to produce double-layered microfluidic chips. I realized I can use this method to build affordable but super durable soft-robots. So I’m building a lab in my garage to do just that.

I’ve always wanted to design humanoid robots that can work in factories and improve the economy. And I just might do it! Could take me a decade though.

## Ziggy

The most important thing going on in my life is my dog (I apologize to my wonderful girlfriend, Meryl). 
She's a <Age />-year-old German shepherd + rottweiler mix (my dog, not my girlfriend). 
She's riddled with social anxiety, so I've been training her to be more relaxed. 
These days she politely watches my neighbor tend to her front lawn. We’ve made so much progress!

Guess who Ziggy is named after?
