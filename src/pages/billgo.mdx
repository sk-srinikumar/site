# Designing for Payments

## BillGO
BillGO's flaghsip product is a white label bill pay platform. Financial institutions like Capital One 
and USAA Bank rely on BillGo's bill pay in their apps and websites.

## Alerts for Bill Pay
I discovered that bill pay doesn't notify users of errors. This caused users to miss payments.
I designed an alerts notification system to immediately notify users. 

The home page populates with cards that clearly communicate what the error is and how the user can fix it.
I placed a contextual call-to-action button that starts the error fixing flow. The cards also use symbols, colors and 
heirarchy to communicate to the user which errors should be fixed first.

Once the feature launched, virtually all users began fixing errors before it was too late.
