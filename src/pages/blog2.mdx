# Logos & Egos
### May 17, 2021

Design isn’t creative as people think it is. Art in general isn’t creative as people think it is. The further music strays away from human speech patterns, the less it sounds like music and the more it sounds like noise. There are rules to all creativity. 

Design is usually a balance of creativity and critical thinking. Sometimes, good design can be just 100% critical thinking. I don't get to be creative as often as I like to, so I capitalize on it when I get the chance.

I needed a logo for my future company. Creating a company can be a miserable experience, so I wanted a logo to marvel at when everything is trash. It’ll remind me of my (almost unattainable) hopes and dreams.

The funny thing about logos is that it’s usually the first thing people make when they care more about feeling good than doing the actual work. And then the project promptly gets abandoned with the logo being the only proof of its existence. 

Thankfully, in this case, I don’t feel as vapid creating the logo before the company even exists. I’ve already spent over a year making some technological progress on synthetic muscles for my robots.

This whole idea of creating robots is absurd and fun. So I made the logo absurd and fun. My logo is a biblically accurate angel with a copyright symbol as an eye. The bible describes angels as being made of wheels within wheels, with many eyes embedded on these wheels, and with many pairs of wings covering these wheels. Also the angel is on fire... or something like that.

<div class="caption"> There's a few different but similar descriptions of angels in the bible.</div>

<div class="caption">Here's my logo for my robotics company.</div>


Religion and capitalism. That’s so American. I love it. 

The protrusions around the circle are meant to be wings/fire/rays/eyes. Yes, it’s meant to be all those things. It’s abstractish!

The ovals and circle are meant to be the wheels that angels are made of. I tried to make the letter A (for American Robotics Company) out of the overlapping wheels, but it’s not that obvious.

The wheels are hollow, so you should be able to see through them. But for some reason, part of a wheel is hidden behind the hollow part of another. It doesn’t make sense, but it eliminates perfect symmetry. Symmetry is nice, but perfect symmetry is suspicious. It also had the added bonus of giving the logo an angle, as if though it’s floating above and looking down on you.

I hate how tiny copyright symbols show up next to logos. It's like having a chaperone at a prom. Just involve them! So I put mine center-stage. There’s a sort of honesty to it. Like you can see the truth through the illusion.

Alright so why an angel? I should have explained that first right? I just like grand mysterious other-worldly concepts. I'm not religious at all, but religion is so important to humanity. There's also a more vain reason.

My best friend Theo likes to call me Gendo. Gendo Ikari is a character from the amazing anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Gendo is a scientist that captures God’s angels and researches them to create his own more useful angels. It’s kinda like how I’m taking god’s design of humans and iterating on it to create robots.

You might be thinking “Wow, Srini, your head is up somewhere”. My response to that is:

<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>“Creativity is the ego expressing itself.” - Satoru Iwata, former CEO of Nintendo </em></p>

My logo is an expression of my ego, like how Travis Scott might rap about his unique success. There's truth to it, but it's exaggerated and mostly for show. Once the song is done, we go back to laying around on the couch and watching TV with our families. 

I think most of the audience misses something very important when they see artistic expressions of egos. There’s a vulnerability to presenting our egos. There’s a recognition that our value is fragile and generic. It's an acceptance of all parts of our humanity.
