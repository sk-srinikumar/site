MDX lets you write Markdown with Javascript. HTML who?  <br  />  <br  />

I used to use Google Firebase to host my site. It costs pennies a month.  <br  />  <br  />


<a href="https://render.com"> Render -> </a>   <br  />
Now I use Render because it hosts your static sites for free.  <br  />  <br  />
