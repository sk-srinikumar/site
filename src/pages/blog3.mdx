# The (Pixel) Art of Animal Crossing Flags
## May 23, 2021

In 2020, the virus overtook our streets and Animal Crossing overtook our hearts. I contributed to our gaming epidemic by designing island flags for strangers around the world.

I’ve been creating pixel art since I was a kid, but my artwork never really went out into the world. So I enjoyed creating free personal patches of art for everyone. 

It all started when I created a flag for myself. I made an account on Reddit just to post an image of it. It blew up. My DMs were flooded with requests and I never said no.

<img height="275px" loading="lazy" src={lily} alt="Lily of The Valley"  class="center"/>
<div class="caption">My personal island flag of a Lily of The Valley.</div>

I eventually stopped (which was possible because I never charged for these). Yet, I still get requests now and then. 

There were 4 big challenges in making these flags:
 
- Each flag had to be personal. So it not only had to have a unique meaningful design for the client, but it also had to be different from other flags I made. 
- The game limits how many colors you can use.
- The artwork has to fit in a 32x32 pixel grid.
- The game tries to smooth out the pixel art to remove hard corners. This creates unintentional results, which sometimes forced me to rethink the designs.

Anyways, here’s a collection of most of my art. Yipeeeee!!!

You're welcome to use any of these flags for your island! I haven't touched Animal Crossing in a long time, so I hope these codes still work:

MA-2550-1514-0719

DA-0916-3665-5805

Send me a picture if you use them!
