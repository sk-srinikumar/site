## HAWTHORNE ADVERTISING
After pioneering the infomercial, Tim Hawthorne founded Hawthorne Advertising. 
A strong history and impressive clientele have made Hawthorne Advertising a cornerstone in the industry. 
I have the honor of designing products for clients like Apple, Nissan, and Nestle.

## SRINI
I’m currently in charge of designing and managing two products.
My team consists of developers, business analysts, and data scientists. 
I’m the sole product designer at Hawthorne, so integration is key to success.

## THE PRODUCTS

Hawthorne Obelisk is a web app we use to manage our entire backend. 
It’s used by every department, so it serves many use-cases and technical proficiencies. 
Version 1 launched in Q1 2021.

Hawthorne Asterisk is also a web app, but for our clients and client managers. 
It will replace our existing reporting tools and dashboards. 
Clients and managers can track their performance once Asterisk launches in Q4 2021.

When I initiated both projects, I gave them their cute rhyming names. But oh boy are they mouthfuls during meetings. 
Try saying Asterisk and Obelisk like 15 times.

## CONNECTING US

Our employees say the backend makes them inefficient. 
It’s not a great feeling when you have to fight with your tools. 
A 30+ year-old tech-stack serving a dozen different departments are bound to rack up UX debt. Designing Obelisk is a Herculean task.

But it’s not impossible. Hawthorne is full of super supportive people. 
Leaders from all departments attend my weekly design workshops. 
I guide them through problem generating and problem-solving exercises.

It’s been rounded way to gain insights and produce solutions considerate of all users. 
Workshopping also organically taught people user-centered thinking.

## TEST & ITERATE

All new solutions are boiled down in scope. 
Small and fast solutions are integral to good testing and iteration. 
It enables me to quickly whip up high-fidelity prototypes in Figma.
When users think aloud while performing tasks on hi-fi prototypes, they have a lot more to say. 
There are also cases where I’ll just slack mock-ups to users and ask for general feedback. 

I conduct continuous exploratory research. 
It’s a fancy way of saying I have discussions with users, analyze our existing tools, and ask our users to teach me how they interact with the backend.
And that's on top of my regular exploration of design in general.

## BUSINESS STORIES

Unlike Obelisk, Asterisk (I told you it’s a mouthful) doesn’t run on user research and testing. 
I’ve been asked not to involve clients in the design process until Asterisk launches, for reasonable reasons. 
It’s unfortunate because the abstract goal of creating stories out of data reports was nebulous... at first.

I silently observe weekly meetings between clients and client managers. 
Our client managers like spreadsheets, but they don’t like our existing data visualizations. 
They think granular tabular data tells engaging stories. Our clients like data visualizations, but they don’t like our spreadsheets. 
They think concise overviews of progress and trends tell engaging stories.

They both want the same thing, but their disagreement on the medium creates disappointment.  

## WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY

According to statistician Edward Tufte, we as a society are not good with data visualization. 
Pie charts have poor UX, bar graphs lie through scale, and we never show what's only necessary. 
I poured through Tufte’s books to understand visualizations that satisfy both my user
groups' needs.

<div class="caption">Tufte introduced this graph of Napolean's army withering away over time in harsh weather.</div>


Napoleon’s march is our golden standard. 
The relationships between multiple granular metrics give rise to concise stories. 
It should satisfy both our clients and managers.


## IN PROGRESS

Inspired by Russia’s winters, my team brainstormed and sketched all kinds of intricate graphs. 
The client managers are excited by our concepts because they open doors to more efficient and comprehensive strategizing. 

Sadly, we discovered that our backend just isn’t able to create these data visualizations. 
The hope is that Obelisk will give us the tools we need to advance our backend to make Asterisk a reality.
At the moment, we use Tableau's API to power basic visualizations.

## TOWARDS THE FUTURE

User-centered development (is that a thing?) can lead to great product support. 
Which is why I stepped up to be the manager. 
It turned out we're actually all interested in pursuing tech that improves UX across the board.

I introduced lean development practices to the team. 
We’re iterating and testing a new backend architecture that’ll make Asterisk a data visualization powerhouse. 
It’s going to enable processing and connecting interesting points like political data and weather data.

Because of my development and data-science experience, I was initially bridging team members by communicating their expertise to each other. 
But now the workshops, passion projects, and our vision for the products have made us quite harmonious.
