# Design, Death, & Robots
### May 17, 2021

I decided that I’m going to design robots. And then I’m going build an entire company around my robots, so I can involve them in the world.

I decided this when I was a kid actually. Designing robots is like the ultimate challenge. Because you’re not just designing a product, you’re basically designing a human as a product.

The greatest boon for humans is our ability to work together in large numbers. We’ve been to the moon because we collaborate like none other. As a whole, we attempt to eliminate each other’s individual weaknesses and invigorate our individual strengths. In theory.

But we do often use the ends to justify the means. We create castes and classes to unfairly benefit from each other. The standards of living have improved but the quality of life has been decreasing. People, in general, are becoming more depressed, at least in the United States.

I don’t know if robots can fix these issues. Maybe it could make them worse. But it’s worth a shot. 

Companies would use slaves if they could (and they have). They want the labor without the human. And robots can be just that. Robots can be a huge weight off of our species. Metal slaves. 

Where does that leave the people? I’m not sure. Hopefully, things will become dirt cheap because of all of that robot labor. But maybe that’s an arrogant glass-half-full view of the economy completely changing. I hope we figure something out.

Robots are gonna be made with or without me. I might as well step in. I think I can do it ethically.

Now, back to reality. Honestly, this is a pipe dream. The chances of me being successful in any way is less than 0.1%. I’m not exaggerating. Still, I’ll die with massive regret if I don’t attempt to make a robotics company. 

First, I have to make a functioning product. On my own. A good robot has to be 3 things:

- Cheap
- Safe to work with
- Easy to instruct

Yes, it has to be cheap. Cheap to produce, cheap to ship, cheap to maintain, cheap to repair. All of it has to be cheap. Saving money is the point. It’s the biggest argument I can make to companies for replacing people with robots. And it’s probably the only real argument I can make for not choosing my competitors. I think polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a cheap substance… maybe. Speaking of PDMS…

The robots have to be safe to work alongside. You know like those robots that exist in factories today? The ones at Tesla putting together your cars? You can’t go near them. If you enter their closed-off space, they’ll knock the soul out of your head. But soft robots made of a gel-like PDMS probably won’t do that. Their power will come from hydraulics. The cool thing about hydraulics is that it naturally creates some natural human motions, like stopping and tucking in when hitting an object. Speaking of human motions…

These robots do have to be humanoid, and not just because they have to do human work. It’s so humans can teach them how to do human work. An average joe should be able to use words and body movements to communicate how to move boxes in a warehouse. And the robot has to see and mimic those motions. And if the robot looks humanistic, then people are gonna naturally want to try to teach it right? Like if the robot had 3 arms instead of 2, nobody would attempt to teach it anything. It’s a good user experience.

I’m not an AI guy. I’ve worked with PDMS and microfluidics. I like to think I’m a good designer. The world is good at manufacturing and stuff. But the AI stuff is pretty new. I think I’ll struggle there. 

So, how am I going to make this happen? First, I know how crazy this is. These are cool ideas but ideas aren’t worth much if they can’t be executed. So I’m gonna spend a few years building a robot. An entire humanoid robot that can at least walk and move boxes around. 

And then, I’ll parade this robot around town looking for investors. That’s all I’ve planned so far.

I do have 2 immediate goals:

- Study human anatomy
- Set up a lab in my house

Nature is the greatest designer. It’s beyond amazing how the form of DNA defines its functions. Replication, spell-checking, security, compression, mutation allowance, and so much other undiscovered stuff all from that helix. I have a hard time believing an alien or god or something didn’t invent DNA. Fun fact: DNA & RNA can’t naturally form on Earth like every other molecular compound in our body can. So it probably came from outer space.

So there’s a lot to learn from studying the human body’s design. But it’s not perfect. I’ve heard that our spines aren’t completely evolved to support our bipedal functions. My back is literally busted from bending down to touch my toes. And I’m still in my 20s. Also, why do so many people wear glasses? I might need a pair soon.

With hydraulics and PDMS, I think I can design a spine that not only curves but also compresses and extends like a piston. It fills in the gap that evolution doesn’t. I hope. Haven’t tried and tested it out yet. Because I still haven’t built my lab.

I used to work in a lab. I researched how to produce microfluidic chips for dirt cheap. I can recreate a similar lab in my house. But this time, my production process might be built around 3D printers. They save sooo much time and hassle. But still, I have to test them out before I decide to rely on them. Anyways, labs aren’t cheap or easy to set up. There’s a lot to this that I just don’t want to get into, or else I’ll go on tangents. But yeah that’s the big hurdle I need to pass.

This entire thing is about me, unfortunately. That’s not a good thing for the world or my future company. So I thought I’d let my ego get its fill here. I can share my thoughts, craziness, and stupidity in this blog. And then I’ll try to keep my personality separate from the company.

Oh, and I want to call my company American Robotics Company. It’s funny because I’m not American.
