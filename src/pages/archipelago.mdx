# Designing A File Explorer

## Archipelago
Archipelago Analytics handles property insurance data for companies like Amazon and BlackRock.
Their online platform handles massive data sets.

## Navigating Data
Since clients were submitting hundreds of files for their properties every week, it made sense we would
launch a file storage solution. In a future iteration, this feature would let you pinpoint the exact files
containing the data you're looking for. But for the first iteration, it would just need to work.

I didn't want this to be just another file exploration. So I designed a unique value proposition: filtering
and organizing capabilities that would let you find what you need faster. Ideally our search function should
work like magic, but we weren't at a point where we could offer that yet.
